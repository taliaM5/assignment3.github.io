            <h3>Earth-1610, home to Miles Morales</h3>
            <p>Earth-1610 is an alternate reality featuring Miles Morales, also known as Spider-Man, and his predecessor, a
                perfect version of Peter Parker. This universe is the primary setting of "Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse"
                and the short film "The Spider Within," as well as appearing in the sequel, "Spider-Man: Across the
                Spider-Verse." </p>
            <p>The universe is notable for being home to two Spider-People and Wilson Fisk, who opened a gateway between
                universes using the super-collider. Peter Parker in this universe lived a perfect life as the beloved
                protector of New York until his death at 26 in 2018. Following his demise, Miles Morales inherited the
                mantle of Spider-Man.</p>
            <p>Miles is forced into heroism to stop Kingpin and prevent a black hole from swallowing Brooklyn. He teams up
                with alternate versions of Spider-Man to overcome challenges. Notable locations include Brooklyn Visions
                Academy, Fisk Tower, and Lenny's Deli & Grocery.</p>
            <p>Notable differences in this universe include Peter Parker's blond hair, his merchandise popularity, and the
                absence of negative press from The Daily Bugle. Miles Morales becomes Spider-Man after Peter's death, and
                there are various cultural differences such as the renaming of brands like Coca Cola to Koka Soda and FedEx
                to RedEx.</p>

            <h3>Earth-65, home to Spider-Gwen</h3>
            <p>Earth-65 is the dimension where Gwen Stacy, also known as Spider-Woman, resides. In this reality's Chelsea,
                New York, Gwen, a member of The Mary Janes, was bitten by a radioactive spider, granting her superpowers.
                She becomes Spider-Woman and faces pursuit by law enforcement after the death of her best friend, Peter
                Parker. </p>
            <p>Key Locations: New York City, Manhattan, Chelsea, Visions Academy, Stacy Residence,Guggenheim Museum</p>
            <p>Notable Differences: The sky appears pink instead of blue. Environmental colors shift with the emotions of
                the inhabitants, especially Gwen Stacy. The world resembles a watercolor painting. Peter attended Visions
                Academy instead of Midtown High School. Gwen Stacy, not Peter Parker, was bitten by the radioactive spider
                and became Spider-Woman. Without Peter becoming Spider-Man, he transformed into The Lizard, indirectly
                killed by Spider-Woman. Consequently, Ben Parker remains alive. The NYPD is referred to as PDNY (Police
                Department of New York).</p>

                spider-like powers to protect the city of Mumbattan. The universe features landmarks like Mumbattan, a
                fusion of Mumbai and Manhattan, and institutions such as Alchemax and Mumbattan Visions Academy. Pavitr
                resides with his aunt Maya, and the dimension includes unique locales like Bronxnagar.</p>
            <p>Notably, many inhabitants are Indian counterparts of familiar characters, such as Gayatri Singh (Gwen Stacy)

                headquarters for the Spider-Society. The world boasts advanced features such as hover cars and a lunar-bound
                train.</p>
            <p>Key Distinctions: New York is referred to as Nueva York. The setting is in the year 2099. Spider-Man's powers

            <h3>Earth-42, the universe where the spider that bit Miles originated</h3>
            <p>In the universe of Earth-42, there are no Spider-People, and crime runs rampant in New York City. When a
                radioactive spider intended for Miles Morales is inadvertently pulled into another universe by Jonathan Ohnn
                using the Super-Collider, it disrupts the natural order. Without a Spider-Man to protect the city, crime
                spreads uncontrollably, plunging New York into chaos.</p>
            <p>Following the death of Captain Jeff Morales, his brother Aaron Davis assumes responsibility for his nephew
                Miles. Aaron mentors Miles in the ways of crime, leading him to become the Prowler instead of Aaron himself.
                The absence of Spider-Man alters the dynamics of this universe significantly, with crime syndicates like the
                Sinister Six/Sinister Six Cartel dominating the landscape.</p>
            <p>Notable differences in Earth-42 include Miles Morales assuming the mantle of the Prowler, the absence of
                Spider-Man, a distinct color scheme dominated by red, green, and purple, widespread crime throughout New
                York, and alterations in brand names such as M&Ms being called W&Ws and Coca Cola referred to as Soda Kola.
                Additionally, while Comic Con exists, it is known as Comics Con in this universe.</p>
