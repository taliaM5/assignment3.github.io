          <h2> Synopsis </h2>
          <div class="under_h2"></div>
          <p>On Earth-65, police captain George Stacy remains unaware that his daughter Gwen is secretly Spider-Woman, who
              is falsely accused of murder due to a misunderstanding during a failed rescue attempt. When Gwen encounters
              the Vulture from another universe, she receives unexpected assistance from Miguel O'Hara and Jess Drew, who
              reveal the existence of the multiverse to her. Gwen discloses her identity to her father George, who
              attempts to arrest her, leading to her escape with Miguel and Jess into the Spider-Society.
          </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, on Earth-1610 in Brooklyn, sixteen months after the Alchemax Collider's explosion, Miles Morales
              faces the Spot, a scientist mutated during the accident who blames Miles for his condition. The Spot reveals
              that he inadvertently caused Miles to become Spider-Man by transporting a spider from another dimension, and
              now seeks revenge. Miles, hiding his superhero identity from his parents, aims to learn quantum physics to
              travel across dimensions and confronts the Spot's accusations about his role in the Collider incident.
          </p>
          <p>The Spot gains enhanced abilities by harnessing the power of other Alchemax Colliders across different
              universes, prompting Gwen to track him to Earth-1610. Reconnecting with Miles, Gwen introduces him to the
              Spider-Society and the threat the Spot poses to the multiverse's stability. Despite Gwen's reservations,
              Miles joins their efforts to stop the Spot's rampage across dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>Miles and Gwen, along with local Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar and Spider-Punk Hobie Brown, confront the Spot
              on Earth-50101, where they witness visions of future calamities. The Spot's actions threaten the fabric of
              reality, leading to chaos and destruction in multiple universes. Despite their best efforts, they fail to
              prevent the Spot from causing catastrophic events.
          </p>
          <p>As tensions rise within the Spider-Society, with Miguel's strict enforcement of canon events and Gwen's
              dismissal from the group, Miles finds himself isolated and targeted by Miguel. Realizing his true role as an
              anomaly in the multiverse, Miles attempts to return home but inadvertently lands on Earth-42, facing
              unfamiliar circumstances and encountering alternate versions of his family.</p>
          <p>As the Spider-Society searches for Miles and the Spot's onslaught continues, Gwen vows to find Miles and
              bring him back, assembling a team of Spider-People from various dimensions to aid in the search and confront
              the looming threat to the multiverse's existence.
